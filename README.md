# **Overview**
This repo contains my best work in Python in both an educational setting and personal work.
### **Educational Setting**
- Reccomender
  - The program gives book recommendations from a set of data provided by users and calculates the average ratings of the books.
- Gerrymandering
  - The program detects probable gerrymandering within a state using data provided by a user via a formatted text file.
- DNA
  - The program reads data (genetic sequences) from a formatted text file and determines if the genetic sequences are proteins.

### **Peronal Project**
- ComposerPy
  - This program takes the information given from two input files and produces a chord progression as well as a small solo piece from user input.
  - **Value Statement**: I wrote this program as a small demonstration for my university jazz history class.  Since my professor was intrigued by computer science and programming, I put together this musical program and we played the output chords and solo piece.
